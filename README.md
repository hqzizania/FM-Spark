# FM-Spark
A Spark-based implementation of Factorization Machines (LibFM)

The code base structure of this project is from [spark-libFM](https://github.com/zhengruifeng/spark-libFM), but the optimization method is based on [parallel-sgd](http://www.research.rutgers.edu/~lihong/pub/Zinkevich11Parallelized.pdf
) which has stronger convergence than miniBatch-sgd.
